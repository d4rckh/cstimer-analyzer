# cstimer-analyzer
This is a collection of scripts I made to analyzer cstimer.net exports

### analyze-time.py
This script analyzes the solve time for your sessions and plot a graph using `matplotlib` (**run `pip install matplotlib` before running the script!**)

Usage: `python analyze-time.py (export-name)`

It will ask you for the session you want to analyze, if you want to calculate mean or average and how to chunk the data (for example mean with chunk of 5 = mo5)
